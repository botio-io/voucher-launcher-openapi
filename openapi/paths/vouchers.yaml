  summary: Create voucher
  description: |
    Generate vouchers and deliver them to a recipient. If no recipient is specified, 
    vouchers will be created but remain undelivered. The delivery method is specified 
    by `recipient_type` and `platform` (refer to the request body description for details).

    Additionally, if `recipient_email` is set and the email voucher option is enabled in 
    the store settings, emails containing vouchers will be automatically sent to the recipient.
